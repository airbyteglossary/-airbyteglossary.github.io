An **AirbyteCatalog** describes the structure of data in a data source. It has a single field called streams that contains a list of **AirbyteStreams**. Each **AirbyteStream** contains a _name_ and _json_schema_ field. The _json_schema_ field describes the structure of a stream. This data model is intentionally flexible.\n\nIf we are using a data source that is a traditional relational database, each table in that database would map to an **AirbyteStream**. Each column in the table would be a key in the _properties_ field of the _json_schema_ field.\n\nIf we are using a data source that wraps an API with multiple different resources (e.g. _api/customers_ and _api/products_) each route would correspond to a stream.","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T05:18:58.216554636Z","tags":null},"/notes/Contribute-to-Glossary":{"title":"How to Contribute to the Glossary","content":"You can either click on `Edit Source` on each page and directly edit on GitHub or you can create an [New Issue](https://github.com/airbyteglossary/airbyteglossary.github.io/issues).\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T05:18:58.216554636Z","tags":null},"/notes/Data-Asset":{"title":"What is a Data Asset","content":"A data asset is typically a database table, a machine learning model, or a report.

This is vital, as with [Data Lake](notes/Data%20Lake.md) and other data stores, and you want the ability to search for your data. Data is growing exponentially, with 90% of the world’s data being generated alone in the last two years. It's hard to keep this amount over time. A data catalog solves the problem of the fast-growing handling of data internally.\n\nAn interesting read about the beginning of the Data Catalog is explained in the 2017 published paper about a [Data Context Service](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p111-hellerstein-cidr17.pdf).

As this data became increasingly available, early adopters discovered that they could extract insight through new applications built to serve the business. The data lake supports the following capabilities:\n-   To capture and store raw data at scale for a low cost\n-   To store many types of data in the same repository\n-   To perform transformations on the data where the purpose may not be defined\n-   To perform new types of data processing\n-   To perform single-subject analytics based on particular use cases","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T05:18:58.216554636Z","tags":null},"/notes/Data-Lakehouse":{"title":"What is a Data Lakehouse","content":"\nA Data Lakehouse open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of [Data Lake](notes/Data%20Lake.md) with the data management and ACID transactions of [Data Warehouse](notes/Data%20Warehouse.md) with Data Lake Table Formats (Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg \u0026 Hudi) that enable Business Intelligence (BI) and Machine Learning (ML) on all data.\n\nThe initial concept was created by Databricks in the [CIDR Paper](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf) in 2017.","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T05:18:58.216554636Z","tags":null},"/notes/Data-Lineage":{"title":"What is Data Lineage","content":"Data lineage uncovers the life cycle of data.

Data Mesh sees [data as a product](notes/Data%20Product.md). Data meshes are also about connecting platforms that those teams are using so data can be easily moved around for the organization's benefit. Companies will try to find better ways of unifying and connecting the tools so that data professionals don’t have to switch and work in a silo.  \n\nData meshes try to eliminate the tensions between decentralizing and centralizing data resources, with some common infrastructure but otherwise mostly decentralized.

The DWH serves to be the data integration from many different sources, the single point of truth and the data management, meaning cleaning, historizing, and data joined together. It provides greater executive insight into corporate performance with management Dashboards, Reports, or Ad-Hoc Analyses.\n\nVarious types of business data are analyzed with Data Warehouses. The need for it often becomes evident when analytic requirements run afoul of the ongoing performance of operational databases. Running a complex query on a database requires the database to enter a temporarily fixed state. It is often untenable for transactional databases. A data warehouse is employed to do the analytical work, leaving the transactional database free to focus on transactions.\n\nThe other characteristic is analyzing data from multiple origins (e.g., your Google Analytics with your CRM data). It is highly transformed and structured due to the ETL (Extract Transform Load) process.","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T05:18:58.216554636Z","tags":null},"/notes/DataOps":{"title":"What is DataOps","content":"Similar to how [DevOps](notes/DevOps.md) changed the way software is developed, DataOps is changing the way data products are created.
